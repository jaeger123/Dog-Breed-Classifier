The task is to perform comparison of different CNN models for Fine-grained Classification task on 133 class [Dog breed dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). The models used are as follows:

Custom 6-layer CNN model
VGG-16 (trained from scratch)
VGG-16 (pre-trained)
ResNet101 (pre-trained)
