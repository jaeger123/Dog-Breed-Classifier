The task is to perform comparison of different CNN models for Fine-grained Classification task on 133 class Dog breed dataset. The models used are as follows:

Custom 6-layer CNN model
VGG-16 (trained from scratch)
VGG-16 (pre-trained)
ResNet101 (pre-trained)
Data can be downloaded from here. Weights for the trained model can be found on the project space here on Google Drive.
